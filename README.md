## The Studio Community (Metaphor)

The way we describe the Developer Studio is that it is a apartment complex and each of you are tenants within the complex.  (hint: Still not sure what a tenant is checkout the [glossary](./glossary.md))

While we, the DevStudio team, are the HOA.

### What can you do as a Tenant
Just like how you move into your apartment you can bring along your furntiue (your content) and decorate your apartment (within limits dedicated by the HOA (i.e. DevStudio team)).

1. You create/edit/publish your own documentation and APIs at your liesure
2. You can provide your own live sandbox
3. You can provide your own API management system

### What must you do as a Tenant
Because the Developer Studio is meant to unify all our products under a single portal that means there are guidelines you must follow.

(WIP)
1. You must have release notes that follow our [template](./release-notes-template.md)
2. You must have a getting started section
3. You must be on open api specification 3.0+
4. You must use our [Markdown syntax](https://developerstudio.fiserv.com/support/docs/?path=docs/md/basic-syntax.md)

Hint: When in doubt look at [Commerce Hub](https://developerstudio.fiserv.com/product/CommerceHub) as an example of what to do.

### What can you NOT do as a Tenant
There is pretty little you cannot do.  If you're not sure, shoot us a message using our [Support](https://github.com/fiserv/support/issues).
